# Harness Jenkins Plugin

A Jenkins plugin that integrates the [Harness CLI (`hc`)](https://github.com/harness/harness-cli) into Jenkins pipelines and Freestyle jobs, enabling you to push artifacts to the Harness Artifact Registry directly from your CI builds.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Harness account (any tier)
- A Harness Personal Access Token (PAT) in the `pat.<AccountID>.<random>.<random>` format

---

## Install and configure the plugin

1. Install the Harness Plugin. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Plugins**.<br><img src="docs/install-plugin.png" width="70%">
2. Configure your Harness CLI details. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **System**.<br><img src="docs/configure-plugin.png" width="30%">
3. Configure Harness CLI as a tool in Jenkins. For more information, see [Configure Harness CLI as a tool](#configure-harness-cli-as-a-tool) section.

## Configure Harness CLI as a tool

To use Harness CLI in your pipeline jobs, configure it as a tool in Jenkins. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Tools**.


### Automatic installation from GitHub

If your agent has internet access, you can configure the installer to automatically download the Harness CLI
from [GitHub releases (harness/harness-cli)](https://github.com/harness/harness-cli/releases).

## Usage

### Step 1: Configure the Harness CLI tool installation

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **Tools** and then navigate to **Harness CLI (hc) installations**.
2. Click **Add Harness CLI (hc)**. Provide a name (for example, `harness-cli`).
3. Enable **Install automatically**, and set the required **Version**. 

    The plugin downloads the binary from the [harness/harness-cli](https://github.com/harness/harness-cli/releases) GitHub releases automatically.

> Note: To always install the latest release, leave the version field empty.


### Step 2: Configure Harness credentials

Go to **Manage Jenkins** → **System** and then navigate to **Harness CLI Configuration**.

![Harness CLI system configuration](docs/screenshot-system-config.png)

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **API URL** | Harness API endpoint. For example, `https://app.harness.io`. |
| **API Token** | Personal Access Token (PAT) - stored as a Jenkins secret. |
| **Organization ID** | Optional. Your Harness Organization slug. For example, `default`. |
| **Project ID** | Optional. Your Harness Project slug. |

The plugin automatically runs `hc auth login` once per agent, per build, before the first `hc` step on that agent. Later `hc` steps on the same agent skip login. If the job later runs on a different agent, that agent logs in again. The API token is always masked in build logs. At the end of the build the plugin runs `hc auth logout` on each agent that logged in.


### Step 3: Use in a Freestyle job

1. In a Freestyle job configuration, go to **Build Steps** → **Add build step** and then select **Run Harness CLI (hc) command**.

    <img src="docs/screenshot-add-build-step.png" width="50%">

2. Select the CLI installation (or leave as **Use hc from system PATH**) and type the `hc` command to run. 
You may include or omit the leading `hc`. For example: `artifact push rpm my-repo /path/to/file.rpm`.

## Pipeline Examples

### Declarative Pipeline - push an artifact

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools {
        harnessCli 'harness-cli'   // matches the name set in Manage Jenkins → Tools
    }

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean package -DskipTests'
            }
        }

        stage('Push to Harness Artifact Registry') {
            steps {
                hc 'artifact push generic my-registry target/myapp-1.0.jar'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Declarative Pipeline - multiple artifact types

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    tools { harnessCli 'harness-cli' }

    stages {
        stage('Push RPM') {
            steps {
                hc 'artifact push rpm rpm-repo dist/mypackage-1.0.x86_64.rpm'
            }
        }

        stage('Push Debian image') {
            steps {
                hc 'artifact push Debian Debian-repo myimage'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Scripted Pipeline

```groovy
node {
    tool name: 'harness-cli', type: 'io.jenkins.plugins.har.cli.HarnessCliInstallation'

    stage('Push') {
        hc 'artifact push generic my-registry build/output.zip'
    }
}
```

### Available `hc` commands (examples)

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `hc version` | Print installed CLI version |
| `hc auth status` | Check current login status |
| `hc artifact push generic <registry> <file>` | Push a generic artifact |
| `hc artifact push rpm <registry> <file.rpm>` | Push an RPM package |
| `hc artifact push Debian <registry> <image>` | Push a Debian image |
